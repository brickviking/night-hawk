v4.0 Intro
----------

This is a restored Unix/Xwindows arcade game I released in the 90s. 
Apart from a few small FX additions, enhancements and bug fixes, the 
game is still the same. Xlib and obsolete OSS support has been replaced 
with OpenGL and OpenAL support. The Starwars sound FX have been replaced 
with my own FX.

It was 26 years ago in October 1996 that I started this project. I 
decided to revise it because I was sad that it had become derelict on 
Eric Gillespie's Sourceforge web site. I felt it was unfinished business 
that it wasn't properly distributed.

Unfortunately, I released versions 2.x with Starwars sound FX, which 
were only meant to be temporally in order to aid me writing the game. I 
struggled with producing FX. To my error, I left these FX in the game. 
This prevented the game being distributed due to IP violations. This was 
the start of Nighthawk's demise.

A note about Eric Gillespie, his involvement in the project, and where 
he fits in. Eric contacted me mid-2003 and asked if he could take over 
the project. I agreed as I had moved on in life and had no intention of 
maintaining Nighthawk. So Eric is the curator/promoter/point of contact 
of this game. He's also the administrator for the Sourceforge and git 
repository sites. Eric isn't a programmer, but has done a lot of good 
work to promote the game on sourceforge. He maintains an excellent 
sourceforge web site and has put a lot of effort into creating it. He is 
also a user and a tester for this project. Eric also seeded the idea of 
the game having a developmental style. When I released nighthawk's floor 
editor (ned) in version 1.0, I had no idea that this editor would appeal 
to certain users to be able to build their own floors and ships. I 
originally left the editor in the source tree for future reference. Eric 
asked me to restore the editor in this version, which I have done. This 
editor is still a developmental tool, but in future versions, this 
editor could be polished for the general public ?. In this version, 
there is a fleet selector for the purposes of users being able to create 
their own fleets (this idea came to life during one of our email 
discussions about ship creation). This feature compliments the floor 
editor.

Restoring this arcade game has been the most addictive personal project 
I have undertaken in years. It's been very satisfying work (more so than 
my electronic projects, as I'm exclusively a hardware man now days. Have 
a look at my web page if you're interested). I think I have left the 
game in a good state for future developers to maintain it's currency on 
modern platforms.

v1.0 Synopsis

Nighthawk is a tribute to one of the most playable and contagious games
ever written- Paradroid by Andrew Braybrook. It was so good, it was worthy
of my attention span for 6 straight months, and was the subject of
conversation at school for many months as well. It was quite amazing seens
that i've never really been into "playing games", the only other game that
lifted my skirt was 3D-Wolfenstein (the pre-cursor to DOOM).

It all started when i was in year 10 (1987). A friend of mine gave me a
copy of Paradroid on a cassette tape (that was the common media for C-64's
among my friends at the time), and that was it!, i was hooked.

Nighthawk was named after the second ship (level) of the original game. It
was extremely difficult to get to this level. If you could slate the
Paradroid level AND Nighthawk level (let alone the other dozen levels),
you were very good, and would have been highly regarded among the
governing pimply faced C-64 evanglist aristocrary at my school (BTW, does
anyone know the full set of ship names in the original game?).

(Nb/ Here is a bit of useless but interesting trivia for you.  Adrian
Bridgett, the Debian maintainer for this distribution noted to me that
Paradroid was also very similar to Quazatron for the Z80 Spectrum, one of
his favourite games. There's also an Amiga variation, and the acclaimed
Paradroid-90 on the Atari-ST).

In October 92 (during the end of my degree i was doing at the time), i
attempted to write a Messydos PC game like this, but didn't have enough
technical knowledge about real time programming and PC's etc. Four years
later, in October 96, started working on this game. Over a period of a
year, i worked on it on and off, to produce 1.0 that was released in
December 97.

Nighthawk has been exclusively written for the Unix/Linux X-Windows GUI,
and have choosen it because it's the most popular, stable, and oldest GUI.
Also, X-windows games are now very fashionable. Some say that
Linux/Xwindows is the game developers preferred choice! (i think i read
that in the Walnut Creek 1998 catalogue?), but i won't go that far yet
anyway ;).


Enjoy..

System Requirements
-------------------

Nighthawk 4.0 was developed using the following libraries on a Mint Linux 
19.2 system. Consider them minimum requirements:

 - cmake 3.13.4
 - ccmake 3.13.4 (optional, to tweak compiler/build settings, enable ned)
 - glibc 2.28 (pthreads and maths library)
 - pkg-config 0.29.1
 - libpng 1.6.36
 - OpenGL/GLU 1.3
 - FreeGLUT 3.2.1
 - Ogg Vorbis 1.3.6
 - OpenAL 1.19.1

The FreeGLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) library is a bit of a funny one. 
This is a very good and very old library, but support has never been 
great on Linux distributions.

If your operating system's software management system isn't able satisfy 
the CMake build scripts, then try downloading the source code from 
sourceforge.net/projects/freeglut. It's a very small and simple source 
tree. It will build on anything.


Installation procedure:
-----------------------

Nighthawk uses the cmake build system. Install game using the following 
guidance (Nb/ This is a tarball example, if the download is a zip file, 
then using unzip etc):

 - Extract tarball/zip file:

	cd ~
	mv ~/download/nighthawk-4.0.tar.xz .
	tar -xf nighthawk-4.0.tar.xz

 - Create build directory and go into it:

	mkdir build
	cd build

- Create makefiles and build game:

	cmake ../nighthawk-4.0

	ccmake .		(Nb/ optional to edit build settings)

	cmake --build . (or make)

- Install game

	sudo cmake --install .  (or sudo make install)

- To run the game, type: "nighthawk"

- To see command line options, type "nighthawk -h"

- To build the floor editor (ned), run "ccmake ." and toogle the 
BUILD_NED option, and then 'make' and 'make install' etc.


Full list of cmd lines (including developer cmds):
--------------------------------------------------

 -h or -?         Display this help info.
 -u <ms>          Display Delay (1 to 100ms) (Developer function).
 -f <Fleet name>  Start at a given fleet.
 -c <Ship name>   Start at a given ship.
 -g               God Mode (No damage, no scores. Developer function).
 -d <filepath>    Specify your own game data filepath (Developer function).
 -s <filepath>    Specify/override user account filepath.
 -v               Verbose logging (Developer function).
