# Nighthawk

Nighthawk is a tribute to one of the most playable and contagious games ever writtenâ€”Paradroid by Andrew Braybrook. Feel the excitement as you battle through hordes of droids to gain your object of removing all droids on the level.

It was originally developed by Jason Nunn under the GPL-2.0 license and was declared as feature-complete in the late 1990s. Later on, brickviking wanted to make some changes, and got Jason's blessing to continue the maintenance of Night-Hawk (as it then became). Since then, it's original CVS was migrated to git and hosted at gitlab, and will be hosted at github for the immediate future with SourceForge and gitlab acting as mirrors, at least for the moment.

The Gitlab mirror is currently at https://gitlab.com/osgames/night-hawk/.

## Development version

We are currently working behind the scenes on nighthawk-4.0alpha, but while you wait, the previous versions are available in [old_versions]. We'd like to see some serious bugtesting on 4.0 when we upload it, issues and other suggestions can be reported here at [the issues link](https://github.com/brickviking/night-hawk/issues).

This new version finally reintegrates sound back into Nighthawk; we've also updated the soundfiles to remove samples from Star Wars so that Debian users can finally play this game with sound.  Package maintainers will be able to update their copies to the latest version. We're also working on removing all the bugs we found.
