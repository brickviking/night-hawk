# Nighthawk

Nighthawk is a tribute to one of the most playable and contagious games ever writtenâ€”Paradroid by Andrew Braybrook. Feel the excitement as you battle through hordes of droids to gain your object of removing all droids on the level.

It was originally developed by Jason Nunn under the GPL-2.0 license and was declared as feature-complete in the late 1990s. Later on, brickviking wanted to make some changes, and got Jason's blessing to continue the maintenance of Night-Hawk (as it then became). Since then, it's original CVS was migrated to git and hosted at gitlab, and will be hosted at github for the immediate future with SourceForge and gitlab acting as mirrors, at least for the moment.
