First, understand what each number in the maps means... i.e. 33 means empty
space, etc.
Second, throw away or remap any numbers not present under NightHawk.
Third, convert file into series of .f maps, one for each "level" or "area".
Fourth, figure out how to choose droids to fill these areas.
  .m files contain doors and elevator positions, as well as transport, power
	bays, and consoles. Noise I haven't figured out yet. but it seems to be:
	  noise_nr   vol  time_to_play
